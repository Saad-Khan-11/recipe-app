Okay so I want this app to have the following functionality.

[ X ] It should allow me to create, update and delete a recipe to and from my database
[ X ] It should allow me to search for a recipe from the api
[ X ] It should have filters that I can select to show specific recipes according to criteria
[ X ] It should have a master products section where all the recipes are present


[ X ] = The functionality hasn't been added yet
[ - ] = The fucntionality is under progress
[ = ] = The fucntionality has been added
